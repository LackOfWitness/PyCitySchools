## Overview
This project aims to analyze the performance of students across various schools in the city. Using data on schools and students, the analysis computes key metrics, identifies trends, and provides insights into academic performance. The analysis covers different dimensions, such as school spending, school size, and school type, to understand how these factors impact student outcomes.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this analysis are:

- **District-Wide Performance Metrics**: Calculate overall performance metrics for the entire district.
- **Individual School Performance**: Analyze and summarize performance metrics for each school.
- **Top and Bottom Schools**: Identify the top and bottom-performing schools based on overall passing rates.
- **Performance by Grade Level**: Analyze performance in math and reading for each grade level across all schools.
- **Spending Analysis**: Investigate the impact of per-student spending on academic performance.
- **Size Analysis**: Examine how school size influences student performance.
- **School Type Comparison**: Compare performance metrics between charter and district schools.

## Steps of Analysis
1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Import data from CSV files and clean it to ensure accuracy and consistency.
2. **District Summary**: Calculate district-wide metrics such as total number of students, total budget, average math score, and average reading score.
3. **School Summary**: Compute detailed metrics for each school, including total budget, per-student spending, average scores, and passing percentages.
4. **Top and Bottom Schools**: Rank schools based on overall passing rates and identify the highest and lowest performers.
5. **Grade-Level Performance**: Calculate average math and reading scores for each grade in each school to identify trends and discrepancies.
6. **Spending Ranges**: Group schools into different spending categories and analyze the average scores and passing rates for each category.
7. **School Size Analysis**: Categorize schools by size and calculate the average scores and passing rates to understand the effect of school size on performance.
8. **School Type Analysis**: Compare charter and district schools to determine which type performs better on average.

## Key Findings
- **District Summary**: Provides a high-level overview of the district's performance, including total budget and average scores.
- **Individual School Performance**: Highlights detailed performance metrics for each school, allowing for comparisons and benchmarking.
- **Top and Bottom Schools**: Identifies the best and worst-performing schools, which can help in recognizing successful strategies and areas needing improvement.
- **Grade-Level Insights**: Offers a breakdown of performance by grade, useful for identifying strengths and weaknesses at specific educational stages.
- **Impact of Spending**: Reveals how different levels of spending affect student outcomes, informing budget allocation decisions.
- **Size and Type Analysis**: Helps understand how school size and type (charter vs. district) influence performance, aiding policy and management decisions.

This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of school performance in the city, offering valuable insights for educators, administrators, and policymakers to improve student outcomes.
