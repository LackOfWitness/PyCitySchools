# Summary of the Analysis

The Jupyter Notebook code ("PyCitySchools.ipynb) performs a comprehensive analysis of student performance data across various schools in the city using two primary datasets: `schools_complete.csv` and `students_complete.csv`. The analysis calculates key metrics such as average math and reading scores, passing rates for math and reading, and overall passing rates. It also examines the impact of factors such as school spending, school size, and school type (Charter vs. District) on student performance. By categorizing and comparing the data, the analysis identifies trends, highlights top and bottom-performing schools, and provides insights into how different variables influence academic outcomes.

## Conclusions

- **Impact of Spending on Performance**: Schools with higher per-student spending tend to have lower average math and reading scores, indicating that higher spending does not necessarily correlate with better performance.
- **School Type Performance**: Charter schools generally outperform district schools in both average math and reading scores, as well as in overall passing rates.

## Comparisons

- **Top vs. Bottom Schools**: The top-performing schools, based on overall passing rates, have significantly higher average scores in both math and reading compared to the bottom-performing schools. This indicates a clear distinction in performance levels within the district.
- **Grade-Level Performance**: Analysis of grade-level performance reveals that average math and reading scores tend to increase as students progress to higher grades, with notable improvements observed from 9th to 12th grade across most schools.
